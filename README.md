**About MPSBase**

Currently, MPSBase consists of a total of 13 studies previously deposited in the GEO and ArrayExpress publically, including 6 MPS types and 4 species. Crossing sample features on the same dataset, we could analyze more than 50 comparisons of normal/control tissues and MPS tissues. Here, we provide gene expression analysis and enrichment analysis to help researchers understand the pathophysiology of Mucopolysaccharidoses.

The database was developed by researchers from the Gene Therapy Center and from the Bioinformatics Core of the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul - Brazil.
